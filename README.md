**Introduction:**
The project's objective is to create a web application akin to Discord, facilitating students in finding study groups and connecting with peers who share their academic interests. Here are the key features:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication for account management and profile customization.

2. **Chat Room Creation**: Allow users to create and delete chat rooms dedicated to specific study topics.

3. **Search Functionality**: Provide a search feature for users to discover relevant chat rooms and study subjects.

4. **Real-Time Messaging**: Enable real-time messaging within chat rooms to foster collaboration among students.

5. **User Profiles**: Display user information, chat room memberships, and activity history on user profiles to enhance engagement and connectivity. 

This project serves as a valuable platform for students to connect and collaborate, especially during remote learning.
